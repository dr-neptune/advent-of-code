idea

I think this is the knapsack problem with 4 constraints
maybe not, just a combinatorial optimization problem

idea
given n inputs, make a linear function for each attribute
then apply and take the max
with 4 ingredients this seems doable by brute force
with many more, it would take some cleverness
