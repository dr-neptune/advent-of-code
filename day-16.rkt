we need to check for tickets that are not valid for any field
maybe we can take each range set and iterate over it for each value?

|#

(pretty-display
 (let ([ranges (first ticket-info)] [tickets (third ticket-info)])
  (for*/list ([ticket tickets])
    (for/list ([field-ranges (map field-ranges (first ticket-info))])
      (for/list ([field-range field-ranges])
      (map (位~>> (range-contains? field-range)) ticket))))))

#|

now we have a data structure

|#

;; hmm, our ts and fs aren't lining up
;; we should simplify it and just iterate over all the ranges since they are disjoint
;; for each number. Then, if a number is all #f, we add it to a list
